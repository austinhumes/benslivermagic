He was absolutely incredible, and such a GREAT addition to our event. Our guests are still talking about him, and it's been over a week. He made an impression that will last a lifetime!"

		I have never seen magic like that before, I really think he has some sort of supernatural powers. Ben Silver was such a hit at our event. He is all our staff talked about on Monday. I hope they book him again for our next event.<br/><br/>

		Ben was amazing with his magic tricks.  We are still trying to figure out how he did them.  We have worked with other magicians, but none have provided the broad range of tricks and left our guests wondering "how did he do that", the way Ben did.<br/><br/>
