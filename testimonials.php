He was absolutely incredible, and such a GREAT addition to our event. Our guests are still talking about him, and it's been over a week. He made an impression that will last a lifetime!"

		I have never seen magic like that before, I really think he has some sort of supernatural powers. Ben Silver was such a hit at our event. He is all our staff talked about on Monday. I hope they book him again for our next event.<br/><br/>

		Ben was amazing with his magic tricks.  We are still trying to figure out how he did them.  We have worked with other magicians, but none have provided the broad range of tricks and left our guests wondering "how did he do that", the way Ben did.<br/><br/>

		Dear Ben,<br/><br/>

		I just wanted to thank you on behalf of HearAid Foundation for taking our annual gala and making it all the 
		
		more special with your incredible talent as a magician.<br/><br/>
		
		 I have to admit initially when I heard we were getting a magician I was a bit ambivalent. I thought it was 
		
		going to be the traditional magic that I'd seen a million times. BOY WAS I WRONG! Your talent and ability 
		
		to engage a crowd going from table to table was so impressive. <br/><br/>
		
		You left us all believing that you have supernatural powers. Seriously! None of us wanted you to stop and 
		
		I only wish we had you perform more! Your tricks were incredible and mesmerizing!<br/><br/>
		
		Thank you again for such a memorable night and looking forward to following you and your career in the 
		
		future!<br/><br/>
		
		Best, <br/>
